 CHECK INITIAL OPEN/CLOSED STATUS OF SELECTED CONTACT ELEMENTS
      AND LIST DETAILED CONTACT PAIR INFORMATION
 *WARNING*: Some MPC/Lagrange based elements (e.g.44316) in real         
 constant set 21 overlap with other MPC/Lagrange based elements          
 (e.g.44757) in real constant set 23 which can cause overconstraint.     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.234   TIME= 21:09:48
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.234   TIME= 21:09:48
 Certain contact elements (for example 48184 & 47029) overlap with       
 other.                                                                  

    3196 CONTACT ELEMENTS &    2281 TARGET ELEMENTS ARE UNSELECTED FOR PREPARATION OF          SPLITTING.
      28 CONTACT PAIRS ARE UNSELECTED. 

 *** NOTE ***                            CP =       1.266   TIME= 21:09:48
 The maximum number of contact elements in any single contact pair is    
 210, which is smaller than the optimal domain size of 2167 elements     
 for the given number of CPU domains (4).  Therefore, no contact pairs   
 are being split by the CNCH,DMP logic.                                  

 BECAUSE SPLIT WAS NOT DONE FOR CONNECT REGION(S), UNSELECTED ELEMENTS ARE REVERTED (SELECTED). 
 *WARNING*: Some MPC/Lagrange based elements (e.g.44316) in real         
 constant set 21 overlap with other MPC/Lagrange based elements          
 (e.g.44757) in real constant set 23 which can cause overconstraint.     

 *** NOTE ***                            CP =       1.828   TIME= 21:09:49
 Smoothing on certain target nodes (e.g.2934) for pair ID 21 may have    
 accuracy issue.  Please verify element normal of connected target       
 elements (e.g.44518 & 44550).                                           

 *** NOTE ***                            CP =       2.312   TIME= 21:09:50
 Symmetric Deformable- deformable contact pair identified by real        
 constant set 21 and contact element type 21 has been set up.  The       
 companion pair has real constant set ID 22.  Both pairs should have     
 the same behavior.                                                      
 MAPDL will keep the current pair and deactivate its companion pair,     
 resulting in asymmetric contact.

 Contact detection at: nodal point (normal to target surface)
 *WARNING*: Smoothing on certain contact/target nodes (for example 2934) 
 may have an accuracy issue.  You may switch contact and target          
 surfaces, or split the current pair into multiple pairs, or use Gauss   
 detection.

 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 in-core memory mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory   
 in order to avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most  
 often results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended   
 if enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to    
 either SAVE the current values or not overwrite them (/EXIT,NOSAVE).
