 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.234   TIME= 21:09:47
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.266   TIME= 21:09:47
 Material number 77 (used by element 55151) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.234   TIME= 21:09:48
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.

 Certain contact elements (for example 48184 & 47029) overlap with       
 other.
